## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Backend Issues

**Issue**: API not responding
**Solutions**:
- Check PM2 status: `pm2 status`
- View logs: `pm2 logs yct-platform`
- Check Nginx status: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
- Verify firewall rules: `sudo ufw status`

**Issue**: Database connection failed
**Solutions**:
- Verify Supabase credentials in `.env.production`
- Check network connectivity to Supabase
- Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
- Check service role key permissions

**Issue**: CORS errors from frontend
**Solutions**:
- Verify `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in backend environment
- Check Nginx CORS headers configuration
- Ensure Vercel domain is included in allowed origins
- Test with browser developer tools

#### Frontend Issues

**Issue**: Build fails on Vercel
**Solutions**:
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check for TypeScript errors

**Issue**: API calls failing
**Solutions**:
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` points to correct backend
- Check browser network tab for errors
- Verify backend is running and accessible
- Check CORS configuration

**Issue**: Authentication not working
**Solutions**:
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check Auth settings in Supabase dashboard
- Verify redirect URLs are configured
- Check browser localStorage for session data

#### Database Issues

**Issue**: SQL script execution fails
**Solutions**:
- Run scripts line by line to identify errors
- Check for syntax errors in SQL
- Verify extensions are enabled
- Check database permissions

**Issue**: RLS policies blocking access
**Solutions**:
- Review RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
- Verify user roles are properly assigned
- Check policy conditions match your use case
- Test with service role key to bypass RLS
