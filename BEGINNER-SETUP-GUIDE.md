# üöÄ YCT ND1 Computer Science - Beginner Setup Guide

**Don't worry if you're new to this!** This guide is designed for complete beginners. Every step is explained in detail with screenshots and troubleshooting tips.

## üéØ What You're Building

You're creating a **complete educational platform** where:
- Students can register and login
- Admins can create courses
- Students can discuss topics
- Anonymous posting is available
- Points and leaderboards motivate students
- Everything works on phones and computers

## üìã What You Need (All FREE!)

1. **Computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
2. **Internet connection**
3. **Email address** (for accounts)
4. **30-60 minutes** of your time

## üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Code (5 minutes)

1. **Download the code:**
   - Click the green "Code" button on GitHub
   - Click "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop
   - You should see a folder called `Yct-main`

2. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal:**
   - **Windows**: Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
   - **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

3. **Navigate to your folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/Yct-main
   ```

### Step 2: Install Node.js (10 minutes)

1. **Go to** [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. **Download** the LTS version (Long Term Support)
3. **Install** by double-clicking the downloaded file
4. **Follow** the installation wizard (click "Next" on everything)
5. **Restart** your computer when done

6. **Verify installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt/Terminal again
   - Type: `node --version`
   - You should see something like `v18.17.0` or higher
   - Type: `npm --version`
   - You should see something like `9.6.7` or higher

**‚úÖ If you see version numbers, you're good to go!**

### Step 3: Install Dependencies (5 minutes)

In your Command Prompt/Terminal, make sure you're in the `Yct-main` folder, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

**What this does:** Downloads all the code libraries your platform needs.

**Wait for it to finish** - you'll see a lot of text scrolling. When it's done, you should see something like "added 1000 packages".

### Step 4: Set Up Supabase (15 minutes)

**Supabase is your database** - it stores all your data (users, courses, posts, etc.)

1. **Go to** [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Click** "Start your project"
3. **Sign up** with your email
4. **Verify** your email (check your inbox)

5. **Create your first project:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - **Organization**: Choose "Personal" (it's free)
   - **Name**: `yct-nd1-main`
   - **Database Password**: Click "Generate a password" and **SAVE IT SOMEWHERE SAFE**
   - **Region**: Choose the closest to your location
   - Click "Create new project"
   - **Wait 2-3 minutes** for it to finish

6. **Get your credentials:**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, click "Settings" (gear icon)
   - Click "API" in the left menu
   - **Copy these 3 things** (you'll need them):
     - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
     - **Anon Key** (starts with `eyJ...`)
     - **Service Role Key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### Step 5: Set Up Your Database (10 minutes)

1. **In Supabase**, click "SQL Editor" in the left menu
2. **Click** "New Query"
3. **Open** the file `sql/main-database-setup.sql` in your project folder
4. **Copy ALL the text** from that file
5. **Paste it** into the Supabase SQL editor
6. **Click** "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)
7. **Wait** for it to finish (you should see "Success" message)

### Step 6: Configure Your App (5 minutes)

1. **In your project folder**, find the file `env.example`
2. **Copy it** and rename the copy to `.env`
3. **Open** the `.env` file in a text editor (Notepad is fine)
4. **Replace** the placeholder values with your real Supabase credentials:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-actual-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-actual-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-actual-service-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-actual-password@db.your-actual-project-id.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Replace:**
- `your-actual-project-id` with your Project URL (without https:// and .supabase.co)
- `your-actual-anon-key-here` with your Anon Key
- `your-actual-service-key-here` with your Service Role Key
- `your-actual-password` with your database password

### Step 7: Test Your App (5 minutes)

1. **In Command Prompt/Terminal**, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Wait** for it to start (you'll see "Local: http://localhost:5000")

3. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

4. **You should see** your platform! Try registering a new account.

**üéâ Congratulations! Your platform is running locally!**
